# dotfiles

Dotfiles for bash, ruby, git, etc.

They assume you're using OSX.

## Installation

    $ chmod +x install.sh
    $ ./install.sh

### Notes
Thoughtbot's [rcm](https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm) is used to safely symlink the dotfiles to the home directory. For more detail theres a great tutorial for rcm [here](https://thoughtbot.com/upcase/videos/manage-and-share-your-dotfiles-with-rcm).
